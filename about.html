      <p>Hi there! My name is Joanna. I am a first-gen student, majoring in Information Technology at UMass Boston.
        A little about me is that I transferred to UMass Boston in 2022 and was majoring in Computer Science but after the first coding class, 
        I quickly decided that it was not for me and always had a passion for Cybersecurity. I enjoy it when my daily tasks aren't repetitive.
